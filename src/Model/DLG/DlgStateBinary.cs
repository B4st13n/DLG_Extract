/* DLG V1 State table (actor responses) https://gibberlings3.github.io/iesdp/file_formats/ie_formats/dlg_v1.htm#formDLGV1_State
 * 
 * Offset	Size (data type)	Description
 * 0x0000	4 (strref)	Actor response text (i.e. what the non-player character says to the party)
 * 0x0004	4 (dword)	Index of the first transition corresponding to this state (i.e. the index in the transition table of the first potential response the party can make in this state).
 * 0x0008	4 (dword)	Number of transitions corresponding to this state (i.e. how many possible responses are there to this state). A consecutive range of transitions in the transition table are assigned to this state, starting from 'first', as given by the previous field, ranging up to (but not including) 'first'+'count'.
 * 0x000c	4 (dword)	Trigger for this state (as index into the state trigger table), or 0xFFFFFFFF if no trigger is used for this state.
